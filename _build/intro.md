<h1>RF Tools Demo </h1>
    
This NeuroLibre tutorial is a fork of John Pauly's tutorial on his rf_tools Octave package, which was presented as part of the Open-Source Software Tools session at ISMRM 2019, in Montreal Canada.

The figures are interactive, and to modi

<h2> Outline </h2>

There are four parts to this tutorial
- RF Pulse simulator -- abr.m
- Shinnar-Le Roux pulse design routines -- b2rf.m, and friends
- Minimum and maximum phase pulses -- dzmp.m
- 2D spiral pulse design -- dz2d.m

The first three sections cover the Shinnar-Le Roux (SLR) pulse design method described in

"Parameter relations for the Shinnar-Le Roux selective excitation pulse design algorithm," J Pauly, P Le Roux, D Nishimura, A Macovski IEEE transactions on medical imaging 10 (1), 53-65
