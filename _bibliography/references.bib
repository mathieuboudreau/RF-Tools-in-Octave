              (MP2RAGE) method achieves spatially uniform contrast across the
              entire brain between gray matter and surrounding white matter
              tissue and cerebrospinal fluid by rapidly acquiring data at two
              points during an inversion recovery, and then combining the two
              volumes so as to cancel out sources of intensity and contrast
              bias, making it useful for neuroimaging studies at ultrahigh
              field strengths ($\geq$7T). To quantify the effectiveness of the
              MP2RAGE method for quantitative morphometric neuroimaging, we
              performed tissue segmentation and cerebral cortical surface
              reconstruction of the MP2RAGE data and compared the results with
              those generated from conventional multi-echo MPRAGE (MEMPRAGE)
              data across a group of healthy subjects. To do so, we developed a
              preprocessing scheme for the MP2RAGE image data to allow for
              automatic cortical segmentation and surface reconstruction using
              FreeSurfer and analysis methods to compare the positioning of the
              surface meshes. Using image volumes with 1mm isotropic voxels we
              found a scan-rescan reproducibility of cortical thickness
              estimates to be 0.15 mm (or 6\%) for the MEMPRAGE data and a
              slightly lower reproducibility of 0.19 mm (or 8\%) for the
              MP2RAGE data. We also found that the thickness estimates were
              systematically smaller in the MP2RAGE data, and that both the
              interior and exterior cortical boundaries estimated from the
              MP2RAGE data were consistently positioned within the
              corresponding boundaries estimated from the MEMPRAGE data.
              Therefore several measureable differences exist in the appearance
              of cortical gray matter and its effect on automatic segmentation
              methods that must be considered when choosing an acquisition or
              segmentation method for studies requiring cortical surface
              reconstructions. We propose potential extensions to the MP2RAGE
              method that may help to reduce or eliminate these discrepancies.",

  abstract = "Improvements in the spatial resolution of structural and
              functional MRI are beginning to enable analysis of intracortical
              structures such as heavily myelinated layers in 3D, a
              prerequisite for in-vivo parcellation of individual human brains.
              This parcellation can only be performed precisely if the profiles
              used in cortical analysis are anatomically meaningful. Profiles
              are often constructed as traverses that are perpendicular to
              computed laminae. In this case they are fully determined by these
              laminae. The aim of this study is to evaluate models for cortical
              laminae used so far and to establish a new model. Methods to
              model the laminae used so far include constructing laminae that
              keep a constant distance to the cortical boundaries, so-called
              equidistant laminae. Another way is to compute equipotentials
              between the cortical boundary surfaces with the Laplace equation.
              The Laplace profiles resulting from the gradients to the
              equipotentials were often-used because of their nice mathematical
              properties. However, the equipotentials these Laplacian profiles
              are constructed from and the equidistant laminae do not follow
              the anatomical layers observed using high resolution MRI of
              cadaver brain. To remedy this problem, we introduce a novel
              equi-volume model that derives from work by Bok (1929). He argued
              that cortical segments preserve their volume, while layer
              thickness changes to compensate cortical folding. We incorporate
              this preservation of volume in our new equi-volume model to
              generate a three-dimensional well-adapted undistorted coordinate
              system of the cortex. When defined by this well-adapted
              coordinate system, cortical depth is anatomically meaningful. We
              compare isocontours from these cortical depth values to locations
              of myelinated bands on high-resolution ex-vivo and in-vivo
              three-dimensional MR images. A similar comparison was performed
              with equipotentials computed with the Laplace equation and with
              equidistant isocontours. A quantitative evaluation of the
              equi-volume model using measured image intensities confirms that
              it provides a much better fit to observed cortical layering.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cortical lesions are common and often
              extensive in multiple sclerosis but are difficult to visualize by
              MRI, leaving important questions about their clinical
              implications and response to therapy unanswered. Our aim was to
              determine whether cortical lesions are better visualized using
              magnetization prepared 2 rapid acquisition gradient echoes
              (MP2RAGE) than T2*-weighted imaging on 7T MR imaging. MATERIALS
              AND METHODS: Brain MR imaging using T1-weighted MP2RAGE at
              500-$\mu$m isotropic resolution, T2*-weighted gradient-echo, and
              T2*-weighted segmented echo-planar imaging sequences were
              collected for 13 patients with MS and 5 age-matched
              neurologically healthy controls on a 7T research system. One MS
              case underwent postmortem MR imaging including gradient-echo and
              MP2RAGE sequences, after which cortical lesions seen on MR
              imaging were assessed with immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: MP2RAGE
              detected 203 cortical lesions (median, 16 lesions/case;
              interquartile range, 15), compared to 92 with T2*gradient-echo
              (median, 7; interquartile range, 8; P < .001) and 81 with T2*EPI
              (median, 7; interquartile range, 5; P < .001). This increase in
              lesion number detected on MP2RAGE versus T2* was observed for
              juxtacortical, leukocortical, and intracortical lesions.
              Forty-three percent of all cortical lesions were identified only
              on MP2RAGE. White matter lesion volume correlated with total
              juxtacortical (r = 0.86, P < .001) and leukocortical lesion
              volume (r = 0.70, P < .01) but not intracortical lesion volume,
              suggesting that pathophysiology may differ by lesion type. Of 4
              suspected lesions seen on postmortem imaging, 3 were found to be
              true cortical lesions while 1 represented postmortem tissue
              damage. CONCLUSIONS: A combination of MP2RAGE and T2*-weighted
              imaging at 7T improved detection of cortical lesions and should
              enable longitudinal studies to elucidate their spatiotemporal
              dynamics and clinical implications.",

  abstract = "Determination of cortical thickness using MRI has often been
              criticized due to the presence of various error sources.
              Specifically, anatomical MRI relying on T1 contrast may be
              unreliable due to spatially variable image contrast between gray
              matter (GM), white matter (WM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).
              Especially at ultra-high field ($\geq$ 7T) MRI, transmit and
              receive B1 -related image inhomogeneities can hamper correct
              classification of tissue types. In the current paper, we
              demonstrate that residual B1+ (transmit) inhomogeneities in the
              T1 -weighted and quantitative T1 images using the MP2RAGE
              sequence at 7T lead to biases in cortical thickness measurements.
              As expected, post-hoc correction for the spatially varying B1+
              profile reduced the apparent T1 values across the cortex in
              regions with low B1+, and slightly increased apparent T1 in
              regions with high B1+. As a result, improved contrast-to-noise
              ratio both at the GM-CSF and GM-WM boundaries can be observed
              leading to more accurate surface reconstructions and cortical
              thickness estimates. Overall, the changes in cortical thickness
              ranged between a 5\% decrease to a 70\% increase after B1+
              correction, reducing the variance of cortical thickness values
              across the brain dramatically and increasing the comparability
              with normative data. More specifically, the cortical thickness
              estimates increased in regions characterized by a strong decrease
              of apparent T1 after B1+ correction in regions with low B1+ due
              to improved detection of the pial surface. The current results
              suggest that cortical thickness can be more accurately determined
              using MP2RAGE data at 7T if B1+ inhomogeneities are accounted
              for.",

  abstract = "PURPOSE: Magnetization transfer in white matter (WM) causes
              biexponential relaxation, but most quantitative T1 measurements
              fit data assuming monoexponential relaxation. The resulting
              monoexponential T1 estimate varies based on scan parameters and
              represents a source of variation between studies, especially at
              high fields. In this study, we characterized WM T1 relaxation and
              performed simulations to determine how to minimize this
              deviation. METHODS: To characterize biexponential relaxation,
              four volunteers were scanned at 3T and 7T using inversion
              recovery fast spin echo (IR-FSE) with 13 inversion times (TIs).
              Three volunteers were scanned with IR-FSE using TIs chosen by
              simulations to reduce T1 deviation, and with MP2RAGE. RESULTS: At
              3T, the biexponential relaxation has a short component of T1 = 48
              ms (9\%) and a long component of T1 = 939 ms. At 7T the short
              component is T1 = 57 ms (11\%) and the long component is 1349 ms
              (89\%). For IR-FSE, acquiring four TIs with a minimum of 150 ms
              (3T) or 200 ms (7T) yielded monoexponential T1 estimates that
              match the long component to within 10 ms. For MP2RAGE,
              significant differences (90 ms at 3T, 125 ms at 7T) remain at all
              parameter values. CONCLUSION: Many T1 mapping sequences yield
              robust estimates of the long T1 component with suitable choice of
              TIs, allowing reproducible, sequence-independent T1 values to be
              measured. However, this is not true of MP2RAGE in its current

              compressed sensing method for fast cardiac T1 mapping in small
              animals. Based on the physics of magnetization recovery, the
              aliasing artifact associated with under-sampling was removed by
              exploiting the sparsity of the signals in the T1 recovery
              direction. Simulation study was performed to evaluate the
              reconstruction accuracy under various experimental conditions.
              Several approaches that accounted for phase variations were

              The analytical solution for T1 precision was derived by standard
              error propagation methods incorporating the noise from the three
              input sources: two spoiled gradient echo (SPGR) images and a
              [Formula: see text] map. Repeated in vivo experiments were
              performed to estimate the total variance in T1 maps and we
              compared these experimentally obtained values with the
              theoretical predictions to validate the established theoretical
              framework. Both the analytical and experimental results showed

              uniform weighting of all FAs, (b) takes into account global
              inaccuracies in the generation of the prescribed FAs by
              estimating the actual FAs, and (c) incorporates data-driven local
              B1 inhomogeneity corrections. The method was validated and its
              accuracy tested using simulated data, phantom, and in vivo
              experiments. Results were compared with existing analysis methods
              and to inversion recovery (IR). Consistency was assessed by means

              compared with literature values. RESULTS: The method accurately
              and consistently estimated T1 values in all cases. The method was
              more robust, in comparison with the standard method, to the
              choice of FA set; to inaccuracies in generation of the prescribed
              FAs (in simulated data, T1 estimation error was 12.1 ms versus
              235.5 ms); demonstrated greater consistency (in vivo study showed

              better agreement with IR on phantom (median absolute difference
              of 123.8 ms versus 790 ms). Reference T1 values were 883/801 ms
              for female/male in white matter and 1501/1349 ms in gray matter,
              within the range previously reported. CONCLUSION: The proposed

  abstract = "B1 errors are a problem in magnetization transfer ratio (MTR)
              measurements because the MTR value is dependent on the amplitude
              of the magnetization transfer (MT) pulse. B1 errors can arise
              from radiofrequency (RF) nonuniformity (caused by the RF coil, or
              skin effect and dielectric resonance in the subject's head) and
              also from inaccurate setting of the transmitter output when
              compensating for varying amounts of loading of the RF coil. B1
              errors, and hence MTR errors, may be up to 5-10\%, a large source
              of error in quantitative MR measurements. Radiofrequency
              nonuniformity may cause MTR histograms to be broadened. The
              dependence of MTR on B1 was modeled using binary spin bath
              theory, with a continuous wave (CW) approximation. For B1
              reductions of up to 20\%, normalized plots for different brain
              tissue types could be approximated by a single line, indicating
              that a systematic correction could be applied to MTR measurements
              with a known B1 error, regardless of tissue type. On a 1.5-T
              scanner with a birdcage coil, MTR was measured in 18 tissue types
              in five controls. The MT pulse amplitude was reduced in steps
              from its nominal value by up to 20\%. Averaging data over all
              controls and tissue types resulted in a line fitting
              mtr(normalized)=0.812b(1normalized)+0.193, where mtr(normalized)
              is the normalized value of MTR (relative to its value at the
              nominal B1) and b(1normalized) is the normalized value of B1
              (relative to its nominal value). For a 20\% reduction in MT pulse
              amplitude (i.e., b(1normalized)=0.80), the mean MTR value for the
              18 tissue types was 7.0 percent units (pu) below the correct
              value. After correction using the single equation above for all
              tissue types, all MTR values were within 1.5 pu of their correct
              value [root mean square (rms) error=0.7 pu]. Magnetization
              transfer ratio values tended to be slightly overcorrected because
              the simple linear correction scheme is only an approximation to
              the true MTR dependence on B1. A B1 field mapping technique was
              implemented, based on the double angle method (DAM), with fast
              spin-echo (FSE) readout, and TR=15 s; this took a total of 6 min
              of imaging time. This was used to quantify B(1) errors and
              correct MTR maps and histograms. However, the cerebrospinal fluid
              (CSF) T1 is very long (approximately 4.2 s); thus, to achieve
              complete longitudinal relaxation (a requirement of the DAM B1
              mapping method), an increase in TR and, hence, acquisition time
              would be required. In general, however, we are not interested in
              calculating the B1 in the CSF, although it is important that the
              B1 is determined in partial volume voxels around the CSF. Using
              our birdcage head coil, whole-brain B1 histograms were found to
              have full-width half maximums (FWHMs) ranging from just 6.8\% to
              11.5\% of the nominal B1 value. The FSE DAM B1 field mapping
              technique was shown to be robust, although a longer TR time may
              be desirable to ensure complete elimination of CSF partial volume
              errors. The procedure can be applied on any scanner where the
              Euro-MT sequence is available, or alternatively, where the
              amplitude of B1 or of the MT pulse can be manually reduced in

  abstract = "Phased array coils are finding widespread applications in both
              the research and the clinical setting. However, intensity
              nonuniformities with such coils can reduce the potential benefits
              of these coils, particularly for applications such as tissue
              segmentation. In this work, a method is described for correcting
              the nonuniform signal response based on in vivo measures of both
              the transmission field of body coil and the reception sensitivity
              of phased array coils, separately. For a uniform phantom, the
              reception sensitivity can be calculated using both Bloch
              equations and transmission field maps. For a heterogeneous object
              such as a brain, a minimal contrast acquisition must be obtained
              to map the receiver nonuniformities. This transmit field/receiver
              sensitivity (TFRS) approach is compared with the standard methods
              of using the body coil to obtain a reference scan and low-pass
              filtering. The quantitative comparison results shows that the
              TFRS approach provides superior results in correcting intensity
              nonuniformities for a uniform phantom. This approach reduces the
              ratio between signal intensity SD of an image and its mean
              intensity from approximately 21\% before correction to 13\% after
              correction. Results are also shown demonstrating the utility of
              this approach in vivo with human brain images. The method is
              general and can be applied with most pulse sequences, any coil

  abstract = "PURPOSE: The variable flip angle method derives T1 maps from
              radiofrequency-spoiled gradient-echo data sets, acquired with
              different flip angles $\alpha$. Because the method assumes
              validity of the Ernst equation, insufficient spoiling of
              transverse magnetization yields errors in T1 estimation,
              depending on the chosen radiofrequency-spoiling phase increment
              ($\Delta$ϕ). This paper presents a versatile correction method
              that uses modified flip angles $\alpha$' to restore the validity
              of the Ernst equation. METHODS: Spoiled gradient-echo signals
              were simulated for three commonly used phase increments $\Delta$ϕ
              (50°/117°/150°), different values of $\alpha$, repetition time
              (TR), T1 , and a T2 of 85 ms. For each parameter combination,
              $\alpha$' (for which the Ernst equation yielded the same signal)
              and a correction factor C$\Delta$ϕ ($\alpha$, TR, T1 ) =
              $\alpha$'/$\alpha$ were determined. C$\Delta$ϕ was found to be
              independent of T1 and fitted as polynomial C$\Delta$ϕ ($\alpha$,
              TR), allowing to calculate $\alpha$' for any protocol using this
              $\Delta$ϕ. The accuracy of the correction method for T2 values
              deviating from 85 ms was also determined. The method was tested
              in vitro and in vivo for variable flip angle scans with different
              acquisition parameters. RESULTS: The technique considerably
              improved the accuracy of variable flip angle-based T1 maps in
              vitro and in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed method allows for a
              simple correction of insufficient spoiling in gradient-echo data.

              MATERIALS AND METHODS: B1+ and variable flip angle (VFA) T1
              mapping were included in our dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)
              breast imaging protocol to study a total of 25 patients on a 3.0T
              GE MR 750 system. We computed precontrast T1 relaxation in fat,
              which we assumed to be consistent across a cohort of breast
              imaging subjects, with and without compensation for B1+
              variation. The mean and standard deviation of B1+ and T1 values
              were calculated for statistical data analysis. RESULTS: Our
              measurements showed a consistent B1+ field difference between the
              left and right breasts. The left breast has an average 15.4\%
              higher flip angle than the prescribed flip angle, and the right
              breast has an average 17.6\% lower flip angle than the prescribed
              flip angle. This average 33\% flip angle difference, which can be
              vendor and model specific, creates a 52\% T1 estimation bias in
              fat between breasts using the VFA T1 mapping technique. The T1
              variation is reduced to 7\% by including B1+ correction.
              CONCLUSION: We have shown that severe B1+ variation over the
              breasts can cause a substantial error in T1 estimation between
              the breasts, in VFA T1 maps at 3T, but that compensating for

              Clinical DCE-MRI datasets of 23 patients with HN tumors were
              included in this study. T1 maps were generated based on
              multiple-flip-angle (MFA) method and different DFA combinations.
              Tofts model parameter maps of k(ep), K(trans) and v(p) based on

              MFA and DFAs were quantitatively evaluated in primary tumor,

              produced remarkable kinetic parameter estimation deviations in
              head and neck tissues. In particular, the DFA of [2º, 7º]

              K(trans) and v(p), significantly (P<0.01). [2º, 15º] achieved the

  abstract = "PURPOSE: B1 mapping is important for many quantitative imaging
              protocols, particularly those that include whole-brain T1 mapping
              using the variable flip angle (VFA) technique. However, B1
              mapping sequences are not typically available on many magnetic
              resonance imaging (MRI) scanners. The aim of this work was to
              demonstrate that B1 mapping implemented using standard scanner
              product pulse sequences can produce B1 (and VFA T1 ) maps
              comparable in quality and acquisition time to advanced
              techniques. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Six healthy subjects were
              scanned at 3.0T. An interleaved multislice spin-echo echo planar
              imaging double-angle (EPI-DA) B1 mapping protocol, using a
              standard product pulse sequence, was compared to two alternative
              methods (actual flip angle imaging, AFI, and Bloch-Siegert shift,
              BS). Single-slice spin-echo DA B1 maps were used as a reference
              for comparison (Ref. DA). VFA flip angles were scaled using each
              B1 map prior to fitting T1 ; the nominal flip angle case was also
              compared. RESULTS: The pooled-subject voxelwise correlation
              ($\rho$) for B1 maps (BS/AFI/EPI-DA) relative to the reference B1
              scan (Ref. DA) were $\rho$ = 0.92/0.95/0.98. VFA T1 correlations
              using these maps were $\rho$ = 0.86/0.88/0.96, much better than
              without B1 correction ($\rho$ = 0.53). The relative error for
              each B1 map (BS/AFI/EPI-DA/Nominal) had 95th percentiles of
              5/4/3/13\%. CONCLUSION: Our findings show that B1 mapping
              implemented using product pulse sequences can provide excellent
              quality B1 (and VFA T1 ) maps, comparable to other custom
              techniques. This fast whole-brain measurement (∼2 min) can serve
              as an excellent alternative for researchers without access to
              advanced B1 pulse sequences. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 1 Technical

              spoiling or fully refocusing the transverse magnetization
              following each excitation pulse. T(1) is extracted from a pair of
              spoiled gradient recalled echo (SPGR) images acquired at
              optimized flip angles. This T(1) information is combined with two
              refocused steady-state free precession (SSFP) images to determine
              T(2). T(1) and T(2) accuracy was evaluated against inversion
              recovery (IR) and spin-echo (SE) results, respectively. Error
              within the T(1) and T(2) maps, determined from both phantom and

              and 2000 ms and 7\% for T(2) between 30 and 150 ms. The
              efficiency of the method, defined as the signal-to-noise ratio

              efficient of those examined. Acquisition time for a whole brain

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: T1 mapping allows direct in-vivo quantitation of
              microscopic changes in the myocardium, providing new diagnostic
              insights into cardiac disease. Existing methods require long
              breath holds that are demanding for many cardiac patients. In
              this work we propose and validate a novel, clinically applicable,
              pulse sequence for myocardial T1-mapping that is compatible with
              typical limits for end-expiration breath-holding in patients.
              MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Shortened MOdified Look-Locker
              Inversion recovery (ShMOLLI) method uses sequential inversion
              recovery measurements within a single short breath-hold. Full
              recovery of the longitudinal magnetisation between sequential
              inversion pulses is not achieved, but conditional interpretation
              of samples for reconstruction of T1-maps is used to yield
              accurate measurements, and this algorithm is implemented directly
              on the scanner. We performed computer simulations for 100 ms<T1 <
              2.7 s and heart rates 40-100 bpm followed by phantom validation
              at 1.5T and 3T. In-vivo myocardial T1-mapping using this method
              and the previous gold-standard (MOLLI) was performed in 10
              healthy volunteers at 1.5T and 3T, 4 volunteers with contrast
              injection at 1.5T, and 4 patients with recent myocardial
              infarction (MI) at 3T. RESULTS: We found good agreement between
              the average ShMOLLI and MOLLI estimates for T1 < 1200 ms. In
              contrast to the original method, ShMOLLI showed no dependence on
              heart rates for long T1 values, with estimates characterized by a
              constant 4\% underestimation for T1 = 800-2700 ms. In-vivo,
              ShMOLLI measurements required 9.0 $\pm$ 1.1 s (MOLLI = 17.6 $\pm$
              2.9 s). Average healthy myocardial T1 s by ShMOLLI at 1.5T were
              966 $\pm$ 48 ms (mean $\pm$ SD) and 1166 $\pm$ 60 ms at 3T. In MI
              patients, the T1 in unaffected myocardium (1216 $\pm$ 42 ms) was
              similar to controls at 3T. Ischemically injured myocardium showed
              increased T1 = 1432 $\pm$ 33 ms (p < 0.001). The difference
              between MI and remote myocardium was estimated 15\% larger by
              ShMOLLI than MOLLI (p < 0.04) which suffers from heart rate
              dependencies for long T1. The in-vivo variability within ShMOLLI
              T1-maps was only 14\% (1.5T) or 18\% (3T) higher than the MOLLI
              maps, but the MOLLI acquisitions were twice longer than ShMOLLI
              acquisitions. CONCLUSION: ShMOLLI is an efficient method that
              generates immediate, high-resolution myocardial T1-maps in a
              short breath-hold with high precision. This technique provides a

              precision (reproducibility) of measurements with the PAIR
              technique was excellent. The coefficient of variation (CV) across
              16 measurements in a head phantom was 2.0\%, compared with a CV
              of 2.7\% across 45 separate measurements in a single subject. The
              within-subject CV was 1.8\% +/- 0.6 in white matter and 1.4\% +/-

  abstract = "Modified Look-Locker imaging is frequently used for T(1) mapping
              of the myocardium. However, the specific effect of various MRI
              parameters (e.g., encoding scheme, modifications of flip angle,
              heart rate, T(2), and inversion times) on the accuracy of T(1)
              measurement has not been studied through Bloch simulations. In
              this work, modified Look-Locker imaging was characterized through
              a numerical solution for Bloch equations. MRI sequence parameters
              that may affect T(1) accuracy were systematically varied in the
              simulation. For validation, phantoms were constructed with
              various T(2) and T(1) times and compared with Bloch equation
              simulations. Human volunteers were also evaluated with various
              pulse sequences parameters to assess the validity of the
              numerical simulations. There was close agreement between
              simulated T(1) times and T(1) times measured in phantoms and
              volunteers. Lower T(2) times (i.e., <30 ms) resulted in errors
              greater than 5\% for T(1) determination. Increasing maximum
              inversion time value improved T(1) accuracy particularly for
              precontrast myocardial T(1). Balanced steady-state free
              precession k space centric encoding improved accuracy for short
              T(1) times (post gadolinium), but linear encoding provided
              improved accuracy for precontrast T(1) values. Lower flip angles
              are preferred if the signal-to-noise ratio is sufficiently high.
              Bloch simulations for modified Look-Locker imaging provide an
              accurate method to comprehensively quantify the effect of pulse
              sequence parameters on T(1) accuracy. As an alternative to
              otherwise lengthy phantom studies or human studies, such
              simulations may be useful to optimize the modified Look-Locker
              imaging sequence and compare differences in T(1)-derived
              measurements from different scanners or institutions.",

  abstract = "In this article, a robust methodology for in vivo T(1) mapping is
              presented. The approach combines a gold standard scanning
              procedure with a novel fitting procedure. Fitting complex data to
              a five-parameter model ensures accuracy and precision of the T(1)
              estimation. A reduced-dimension nonlinear least squares method is
              proposed. This method turns the complicated multi-parameter
              minimization into a straightforward one-dimensional search. As
              the range of possible T(1) values is known, a global grid search
              can be used, ensuring that a global optimal solution is found.
              When only magnitude data are available, the algorithm is adapted
              to concurrently restore polarity. The performance of the new
              algorithm is demonstrated in simulations and phantom experiments.
              The new algorithm is as accurate and precise as the
              conventionally used Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm but much
              faster. This gain in speed makes the use of the five-parameter
              model viable. In addition, the new algorithm does not require
              initialization of the search parameters. Finally, the methodology
              is applied in vivo to conventional brain imaging and to skin
              imaging. T(1) values are estimated for white matter and gray
              matter at 1.5 T and for dermis, hypodermis, and muscle at 1.5 T,
              3 T, and 7 T.",

  abstract = "Purpose There are many T1 mapping methods available, each of them
              validated in phantoms and reporting excellent agreement with
              literature. However, values in literature vary greatly, with T1
              in white matter ranging from 690 to 1100 ms at 3 Tesla. This
              brings into question the accuracy of one of the most fundamental
              measurements in quantitative MRI. Our goal was to explain these
              variations and look into ways of mitigating them. Theory and
              Methods We evaluated the three most common T1 mapping methods
              (inversion recovery, Look-Locker, and variable flip angle)
              through Bloch simulations, a white matter phantom and the brains
              of 10 healthy subjects (single-slice). We pooled the T1
              histograms of the subjects to determine whether there is a
              sequence-dependent bias and whether it is reproducible across
              subjects. Results We found good agreement between the three
              methods in phantoms, but poor agreement in vivo, with the white
              matter T1 histogram peak in healthy subjects varying by more than
              30\% depending on the method used. We also found that the pooled
              brain histograms displayed three distinct white matter peaks,
              with Look-Locker consistently underestimating, and variable flip
              angle overestimating the inversion recovery T1 values. The Bloch
              simulations indicated that incomplete spoiling and inaccurate B1
              mapping could account for the observed differences. Conclusion We
              conclude that the three most common T1 mapping protocols produce
              stable T1 values in phantoms, but not in vivo. To improve the
              accuracy of T1 mapping, we recommend that sites perform in vivo
              validation of their T1 mapping method against the inversion
              recovery reference method, as the first step toward developing a
              robust calibration scheme. Magn Reson Med 73:514--522, 2015.
